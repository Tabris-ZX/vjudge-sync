# VJudge AC Automaton (VJudge の AC自动机)
This tool is designed for **one-click synchronization of problem-solving data from various Online Judges (OJs) linked to your VJudge account**, making it easy to track your overall progress and statistics in one place.

## Quick Start

### For Synchronizable OJs (Except NowCoder)
1. Works instantly if you have installed the script and linked these accounts on VJudge .

2. Navigate to the VJudge website; a control panel will appear on the side.

3. Select the OJs you wish to sync and click "One-click Sync" (一键同步).

4. To stop the synchronization, simply refresh the page (the "stop" button hasn't been implemented yet!).

### For Experimental OJs (Currently NowCoder only)
Syncing is not recommended for now due to several ongoing issues. (Issues include rate limiting and missing problem data; these will be addressed in future versions.)
